- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800), used sparingly to draw attention to key interactive elements and actionable items.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. The former is techy, while the latter is objective and neutral, and together they create a readable, professional look.
